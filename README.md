# CareBot

The project aims to develop an elderly care in-house robot with the functionality to find the user and deliver medications. 

The care robot monitors the Bluetooth sensor signal of the peripheral user device and moved towards the user delivering the medicines. The robot uses ultrasound sensors to avoid obstacles on its way.
